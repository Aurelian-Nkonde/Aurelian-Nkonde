- 👋 Oi, como vai esta?.
- 👀 I love the ups and downs of it. It's never all roses and petals, but I love the comfort of fixing an error that has been racking my head. It's truly a win for me.
- 🌱 I'm currently battling with TypeScript and JavaScript on a daily basis, and I'm also learning Clojure (I survived the brackets war!)
- 💞️ I’m open to any collaborations
- 📫 here's my email address, aurelianrobot@gmail.com
